If there exists a parallel world where losers are guaranteed to find salvation, Girish A.D’s characters would probably be the rulers of that world. Down and out protagonists have been a common factor in all his films till date, be it Thanneer Mathan Dinangal or Super Sharanya or Premalu. His latest outing I Am Kathalan is no different, but just as always, he brings the same underlying theme in a different packaging.

Cyber crime is the shiny wrapper that he uses this time around. Only that, we are seeing the film mostly from the perspective of the hacker, Vishnu (Naslen), who has completed his engineering course but has a load of back papers to pass. His lack of ambition and string of failures do not sit well with his girlfriend Shilpa (Anishma Anilkumar), who has joined her father (Dileesh Pothan)‘s finance firm as its IT head. When things go wrong between the couple, it triggers Vishnu’s criminal tendencies.

<p>Girish AD, Malayalam's super successful director of romcoms, has changed from his usual template to tell the story of a young hacker in 'I am Kathalan', his latest outing. The techno-thriller features Naslen, who has collaborated with Girish several times. This time, he plays a young engineering student with plenty of back papers who struggles to find a job. His relationship with his girlfriend Shilpa (Anishma) is on the rocks, especially when she realises he has hacked her Instagram account.</p>

How many servers would you hack for love? A silly attempt to win back his girlfriend turns into a dangerous game of revenge for Vishnu where he must risk everything he ever cherished.

I Am Kathalan movie review: As Vishnu (Naslen K Gafoor) hacked into the Royal Periyadan Finance’s server from his personal computer, I scanned every corner of his CRT monitor, half-expecting the word “hacking…” to pop up — an all-too-common trope in such scenes. However, in his techno-thriller I Am Kathalan, director Girish AD has steered clear of such clichés, and, believe me, that’s, unfortunately, a rare feat. Keep in mind that it hasn’t been too many years since director Joshiy, depicted in his movie Salaam Kashmier (2014), the Indian military’s cyber intelligence wing commanding officer Major Sreekumar (Jayaram) introducing Lt Colonel Tomy Eepan Devasy (Suresh Gopi) to “this latest technology” used by terrorists to communicate among themselves, called “Facebook.” Given that some filmmakers are that naïve about their surroundings and the evolving scenarios around them, what Girish has done here is no small achievement.

So the history of I am Kathalan, the first movie of Naslen as a hero, is that it was shot before Premalu, and due to production delays, the release got pushed. So, coming to the content of this cyber-thriller, the on-screen authenticity that stages this film in a very simplistic way makes the movie pretty engaging for its brisk runtime of 1 hour and 51 minutes. Similar to his other comedy films, Girish A D has opted for a setting with introverted characters and relatable emotions. The only issue was that the cat and mouse game in the whole movie is not getting that high one would love to see as it approaches a morally correct conclusion.

Iam Kathalan is a Malayalam romantic-comedy movie directed by Gireesh A.D. The movie features Naslen G Gafoor and Lijomol Jose in the lead roles.

The screenplay for the movie is crafted by Sajin Cherukayil. Sharan Velayudhan serves as the cinematographer, while Akash Joseph Varghese takes on the role of editor. Siddhartha Pradeep handles the music composition for the film.

Synopsis
<p>It is a film about women who were highly influenced by the Vajrayana and Tantric tradition of Budhism which was prevalent in Odisha and some other eastern states between the 8th and the 12th Centuries. The film is a lyrical expression of the story of 28 women, mostly from the marginalised and suppressed sections of the society and their fearless struggle to free themselves from the bondage of tradition to fulfil the desires of their mind and body.</p>

The trailer of I am Kathalan, actor Naslen’s upcoming Malayalam film with Premalu-maker Girish AD, was released by the makers on Saturday (October 26, 2024). Written by Sajin Cherukayil, the film is set for a release on November 7.

The trailer shows Naslen as a hacker who uses a pseudonym — Kathalan — to hack into the systems of a private company called Royal Periyadan, owned by Dileesh Pothan’s character. We aren’t given the full details of Kathalan’s motives, only that his actions are driven by a desire for revenge. Meanwhile, we also see Lijomol Jose’s character attempt to unmask the man behind the hacks.
